# Java Honeypot System

A **Honeypot server** built in Java for detecting suspicious network activity, such as rapid scanning or Nmap probes.  
This project simulates a fake web server to attract and log potential attackers, while recording IPs, device details, and timestamps.

- Serves a **fake HTML page** (`login.html`) to simulate a web server  
- Saves logs to a configurable log file (`logs/connections.log`)  
- Simple concurrency-safe handling using `ConcurrentHashMap`
